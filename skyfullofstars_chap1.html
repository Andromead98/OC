        <p>Cassi froze. She wasn’t on Ditaeon anymore, instead she was surrounded by gleaming white pipes, tubes and wires. The Pathfinders’ mind swimming, trying to figure out where she was. Her legs felt weak.
          <br>“Who are you?” A voice called out, their scottish accent rolling over the words, “How did you get in here?”
          <br>Cassi turned towards the voice, the edges of her vision going blurry.
          <br>“I- Where am I?” Cassi hated how scared she sounded. Dropping to her knees, everything went black before she could get an answer.
          <br>
          The first thought Cassi had when she awoke was that her whole body ached. No one had caught her when she’d fallen. Forcing her eyes open, there were a few things she noticed straight away. First, both of her wrists were secured to both sides of the medical cot. The second was a holo-poster against one of the walls reading ‘175th Anniversary! Victory Over The Reapers’. Same universe, different galaxy. Good. Cassi could work with that. The third thing she noticed were the two low voices talking quietly behind one of the room’s portable walls. Thankful for her implants, Cassiopeia strained her ears to listen to the conversation beyond the wall.
          <br>“- Should be dead. No one can function with that much brain trauma, Jim”
          <br>“If that’s the case, how’d she get into Engineering?”
          <br>“Fuck if I know” the first responded, exasperated, “Ask your science team. You said Spock had reported weird energy readings”
          <br>The second voice hummed “Should we get T’Soni to look into it?”
          <br>T’Soni? Cassi hoped to god that they meant Liara.
          <br>“Liara T’Soni?” Cassi called out, “Do you mean Liara T’Soni?”
          <br>The voices fell silent, and after a moment they both came round the portable wall to stand at the end of her medical bed. The taller of the two men, a blonde wearing a muddy-yellow shirt with an A-shaped logo on the left, spoke first.
          <br>“I’d like for you to answer some questions.”
          <br>“Is Liara here?” Cassi shot back, her voice almost pleading, “She knows me”
          <br>“Who are you?”
          <br>“I’ll tell you if I can speak to Liara”
          <br>The blonde looked at his companion, an eyebrow raised in a silent question. His companion, a man with dark hair and hazel eyes dressed in blue, shook his head, a frown creasing his face.
          <br>“Fine, Bones, call Doctor T’Soni”
          <br>Cassi felt her body relax, not realising how tense she had become. Letting out a breath of relief, she murmured
          <br>“Cassiopeia Shepard”
          <br>“Captain Kirk” he introduced himself, and motioning to the other man, “and this is Doctor McCoy”
          <br>Doctor McCoy nodded at Cassi, and left the room.
          <br>“I’d say ‘It’s a pleasure’, but it’s hard to say that when I’m strapped to a cot”
          <br>Kirk laughed, a bright, friendly smile now on his face.
          <br>“Thats fair”
          <br>Not a moment later, Doctor McCoy returned, closely followed by Liara T’Soni. It was strange seeing Liara after all this time, she hadn’t changed in the slightest. Before either the Doctor and Captain could say anything, Liara’s eyes landed on Cassiopeia.
          <br>“By the Goddess” Liara’s voice was more airy than the Pathfinder remembered “Cassiopeia? How are you here?”
          <br>“Good to see you too, Blue” Cassi responded dryly, a fond smile gracing her freckled face, “And I don’t exactly know, things are ‘fuzzy’”
          <br>Liara’s grey-blue eyes flicked to the younger woman’s restraints, her brows raising slightly, her voice fond when she spoke
          <br>“Just like your sister”
          <br>“Doctor T’Soni?” Kirk started, drawing the Asari’s attention “You know her?”
          <br>“I do” she nodded, “but I don’t quite understand how she’s here. The last time I saw her was over a hundred years ago…”
          <br>The room fell silent, and Cassiopeia’ supposed this made the most sense.
          <br>“And to think that there’s currently a younger me, somewhere in dark space, on her way to Andromeda” Liara’s eyes lit up with a familiar curiosity that Cassi had missed.
          <br>“So you made it there? What was it like? Were there new lifeforms?”
          <br>Cassi laughed as Liara rattled off questions, lifting her data pad to record Cassi’s responses, it was a comfort to see Liara ‘nerd out’ again.
          <br>“Wait, Andromeda? You were part of the Andromeda Initiative?” Kirk’s eyebrows rising, “How on  earth did you get here?”
          <br>Cassi shrugged in response, “Like I said to Liara, things are fuzzy”
          <br>“The scans that we ran on your brain showed significant trauma, that’s most likely the cause of the ‘fuzziness’” Doctor McCoy spoke, bringing up a holo to show Cassiopeia the data.
          <br>“It could be,” Cassiopeia contended, “But I’ve been dealing with that for years, Andromeda was a hot mess.”
          <br>“A mess?” Liara’s features turned to a frown, “I thought the scans were promising?”
          <br>“A lot can change in 600 years, we lost a lot of good people” Cassi fell silent, the memories washing over her.
          <br>“Doctor T’Soni, a word?” Kirk motioned for the Asari scientist to follow. After sending a small, reassuring smile, Liara followed her Captain
          <br>
          It took almost a week for McCoy to discharge Cassi from the medbay and even then it was under the strict condition that she attend a weekly medical check-up, he was still worried about her brain trauma. Cassiopeia had quickly agreed to the terms, it wasn't that she disliked the Doctor, he was nice and they'd begun some sort of a budding friendship, but Cassi was someone who had to be doing something. She'd been going stir-crazy in that medbay.
          <br>When she was discharged, the Captain met her alongside Commander Spock,a tall man with green tinged skin and pointed ears.
          <br>“Miss Shepard” the Commander nodded in way of greeting, “The Captain and Doctor T'Soni have briefed me on your situation. In line with Star Fleet regulation, you have been afforded the opportunity to earn your keep on this ship. I would like to discuss your position with you further”
          <br>Kirk watched on, slightly amused, an eyebrow cocked with a mischievous glint in her eyes.
          <br>“You can discuss that later,” Kirk grinned, “I'll be giving our newest crewman the tour!”
          <br>Kirk motioned for Cassiopeia to follow, ignoring Spock's protests.
          <br>“So, Cassiopeia Shepard, tell me about yourself”
          <br>“Do you always ask for the life story of someone you've only just met, Captain?”
          <br>“Only when that someone has appeared from thin air, in the middle of my ship” He grinned, and Cassi found that his smile was contagious.
          <br>“Where'd you like me to start?”
          <br>“What did you do before Andromeda?”
          <br>“I was apart of the Alliance's Prothean Research team for a while, before I was transferred to the Normandy. It’s where I met Liara.”
          <br>“Prothean Research…? Isn't that T'Soni's focus?”
          <br>Cassi hummed in agreement, as they reached their first destination.
          <br>“This is the Requisition Bay” Kirk explained, “You'll get fitted for your uniform here, and whatever else you might need”
          <br>“Any rules I should know about?”
          <br>“Just your usual: no alcohol, no drugs, etcetera. Anyways, on with the tour!”
          <br>His pace was fast and energetic, and Cassi almost had to jog to keep up with him. She only caught up to him, when he stopped in-front of the turbo-lift. As they stepped inside, the Captain’s questions started again
          <br>“Why did you join the Andromeda Initiative?”
          <br>“A mix of reasons” She paused, her memories creeping back to the forefront of her mind “I wanted to see new stars, uncover new mysteries. I wanted to walk somewhere no other human had walked before. That and my career with the Alliance wasn’t going anywhere”
          It was the truth, not all of it, but it was the parts that she could stand to let a complete stranger know. With each new section of the ship, the Captain had another question. It reminded her of Rhyland, and she could tell that he showed just as much interest in her as he did with all his other crew members.</p>
