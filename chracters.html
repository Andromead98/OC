          <p>Cassiopeia was born and raised on Mindoir. When Cassi and her twin, Scott, were 7 and her older sister, Rhyland, was 16; Mindoir was attacked by Batarian Slavers. Cassi, Scott and Rhyland managed to hide themselves until the Alliance arrived. This left the Shepard siblings three of only a small group of survivors.
          One of the Alliance officers, David Anderson, knew of a couple, Alec and Elen Ryder, that were wanting to adopt. Not long after the siblings were adopted, Rhyland joined the Alliance, and Cassiopeia and Scott would later follow their older sister. Cassiopeia's career in the Alliance Military was short. She was apart
           of the Prothean Artifacts Research team, where she worked to unlock the secrets each artifact held, as well as working as on-site security for the excavation teams. When her adoptive father was caught researching and experimenting with Artificial Intelligence, Cassiopeia was shunned by her superior officers and was
          quietly transferred to Unit 212's 'Dog Squad'. After two years, the Dog Squad was deployed to Eden Prim where she would be one of two survivors of the Geth's attack. Following the attack, Cassiopeia was transfered to her older sister's command to help hunt down Saren. After the Normandy was attacked and Rhyland was
        kiled, Cassiopeia accepted her adoptive-Father's offer to join the Andromeda Initiative alongside her twin brother.</p>
