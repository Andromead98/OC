          <h3>Cassiopeia Sara Shepard-Ryder</h3>
          <p>Cassiopeia, Scott and Rhyland were born and raised on Mindoir. When Cassiopeia and Scott were 7 and Rhyland was 16, Mindoir was attacked by Batarian Slavers. Rhyland was able to hide himself and his younger siblings until Alliance arrived, leaving the three Shepherd children the only surviving members of their family. One of the Marines knew of a couple, Alec and Ellen Ryder, that were wanting to have children and were unable to, after mentioning the Shepard children to the couple, they were adopted. Not long after, Rhyland joined the Alliance, and Cassiopeia and Scott would later follow their older brother.
Cassiopeia’s career in the Alliance Military was short. She was apart of the Prothean Artifacts Research team, where she worked to unlock the secrets that each artifact held, as well as working as on-site security for the excavation teams. When her adoptive father was caught researching and experimenting with Artificial Intelligence, Cassiopeia was shunned by her superior officers and quietly transferred to Unit 212’s ‘Dog Squad’. After two years, the Dog Squad was deployed to Eden Prime where she would be one of two survivors of the Geth’s attack. Following the attack, Cassiopeia was transferred to her older brother’s command to help hunt down Saren. After the Normandy was attacked and Rhyland was killed, Cassiopeia accepted her adoptive-Father’s offer to join the Andromeda Initiative alongside her twin brother.</p>
